# All of the projects listed on this landing page are written in C#, but since there techically isn't any **code** here, GitHub isn't listing the language on the repository page.
#
# By placing this file, with a ".cs" extension...and then adding a line to the .gitattributes file (since for some reason .cs is seen as SmallTalk), the language is correctly displayed.
